Welcome to FrostyFan! Please have a look at the wiki. It explains the app and shows how I solved a few specific issues in Swift.

An earlier version of this app is available on the App Store (although you need to have a fan to use it). If you want to see it in action, a few of these wiki pages include videos.

I'll be releasing this version (which uses SwiftUI, Async, and Combine) after I've completed some testing.
